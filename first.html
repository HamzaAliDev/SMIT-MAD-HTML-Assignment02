    <h2>Semantic Elements</h2>
    <p>
        &emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;
        When building web pages, we use a combination of non-semantic HTML <br />
        and Semantic HTML. The word semantic means <b>"relating to meaning"</b>, so <br />
        semantic elements provide information about the content between the <br />
        opening and closing tags. <br />
        &emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;
        By using Semantic HTML, we select HTML elements based on their <br />
        meaning, not on how they are presented. Elements such as <b>&lt; div &gt;</b> and <br />
        <b>&lt; span &gt;</b> are not semantic elements since they provide no context as to what is <br />
        inside of those tags. <br />
        &emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;
        For example, instead of using a <b>&lt; div &gt;</b> element to contain our header <br />
        information, we could use a <b>&lt; header &gt;</b> element, which is used as a heading <br />
        section. By using a <b>&lt; header &gt;</b> tag instead of a <b>&lt; div &gt;</b> , we provide context as to
        <br />
        what information is inside of the opening and closing tag.

    <h2>Why Use semantic Elements?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Accessbility:</b> Semantic HTML makes webpages accessible for mobile <br />
                devices and for people with disabilities as well. This is because screen <br />
                readers and browsers are able to interpret the code better.

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>SEO:</b> It improves the website <b>SEO</b>, or <b>S</b>earch <b>E</b>ngine <b>O</b>ptimization,
                which <br />
                is the process of increasing the number of people that visit your webpage. <br />
                With better <b>SEO</b>, search engines are better able to identify the content <br />
                of your website and weight the most important content appropriately.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Easy to Understand:</b> Semantic HTML also makes the website's source <br />
                code easier to read for other web developers.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        &emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;
        To better understand this, you can think of comparing non-semantic HTML <br />
        to going into a store with no signs on the aisles. Since the aisles aren't labeled, <br />
        you don't know what products are in those aisles. However, stores that do <br />
        have signs for each aisle make it a lot easier to find the items you need, just <br />
        like Semantic HTML.
        <br />
        &emsp;&ensp;&nbsp;
        Many web sites contain HTML code <b>&lt; div id="header" &gt;</b> , <b>&lt; div <br />
            id="nav" &gt;</b> , <b>&lt; div id="main" &gt;</b> , <b>&lt; div id="footer" &gt;</b> to indicate <br />
        header, navigation, main content and footer.
